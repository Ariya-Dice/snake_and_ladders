User Guide for Snakes and Ladders
The Snakes and Ladders game is an exciting and competitive game that is played online using smart contracts on the blockchain. In this game, players roll dice and move across the game board in an effort to reach the finish line. This game is entirely based on chance, and the rules and gameplay are detailed below. The game is set up for the BNB Testnet. You need to acquire some TBNB (faucet) from the address (https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet). All funds you send to the game are under the complete control of the smart contract on the blockchain. No one has access to them. All calculations and payments are performed by the smart contract. The first 5,000 participants will receive special game tokens as rewards in the future.

Moving in the Game:
- The random number generation for the dice is executed by two separate systems (in the application and the smart contract), ensuring randomness to the greatest extent possible. Each player moves by rolling a die (a random number between 1 and 6).
- Players play individually, and there are no turns for rolling the dice.
- Each player can roll the dice once every 12 hours and must move their frog during this time.
- If a player lands on a position that is the end of a ladder, they will be moved up to the higher position. If they land on the head of a snake, they will be moved down to the lower position.

Antidote:
- Players can purchase an antidote for a fee of 0.002 BNB. Each player can have a maximum of 3 antidotes.
- If a player encounters a snake and has an antidote, they can use it to avoid the negative effects of the snake encounter.
- If a player is bitten by a snake three times and does not have an antidote, their frog will die, and they will be eliminated from the game.

Winning:
- The player to reach position 100 wins the game.
- Winners are ranked based on the number of dice rolls they made during the game:
- If a player wins with 9 rolls or fewer, they will be placed in Group 1 and receive a special prize.
- The more dice rolls a player has, the higher the group ( 2 && 20 ) they will be placed in, resulting in a lower prize.
- If a player does not win within a maximum of 29 rolls, their frog will die, and they will be eliminated from the game.

Inactive States:
- If a player does not roll the dice or move their frog for 12 hours, their frog will die, and they will be eliminated from the game.

Prize Distribution:
- Prizes are distributed among winners based on predetermined percentages. These percentages are divided among different groups of winners based on their number of dice rolls.
